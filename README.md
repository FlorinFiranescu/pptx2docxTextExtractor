# pptx2docxTextExtractor
This script is supposed to open a pptx presentation, extract all the text with its format and save inside a word document, properly formated (with the bold/italic, some pre-set size and also the bullet points).
The following libraries are used:
  -> pptx to open the pptx document
  -> docx to write and save the docx converted document
  -> tkinter to open a pop-up window in order to select the pptx file that is wanted to be converted
  -> pathlib to get the name of the file and the path, in order to save the docx next to it
